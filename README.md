# Capstone2020

Developing wearable armband for collecting ECG and Pulse Oximetry data and using machine learning to predict risk scores of Acute Myocardial Infarction

Project in two parts:
  1. Research into MIT-BIH and ECGView datasets (comprehensive cardiovascular datasets)
  2. Designing and testing industry standard PCB board housing sensors, processing, and communication units
  3. Processed datasets above and ran classification algorithms (SVM, Logistic Regression, CNN) in Python with Keras
